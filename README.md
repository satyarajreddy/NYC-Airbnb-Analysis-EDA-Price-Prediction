# NYC-Airbnb-Analysis-EDA-Price-Prediction
## The main influence for this project came in as we often find ourselves immersed in the how a giant like Airbnb predicts the prices for their hosts: 
 - ### What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
 - ### What can we learn from the predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc.)
 - ### Which hosts are the busiest and why?
 - ### Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

### This project aims to solve the problems using ML techniques to predict the prices for listings in the NYC area along with performing EDA in the due course.
